## Risk Management

| Risk                                          | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Twitch API changes                            | Medium      | High   | Monitor Twitch developer announcements, build abstraction layer |
| Performance issues with many concurrent users | Medium      | High   | Regular load testing, performance optimization                  |
| Security vulnerabilities                      | Low         | High   | Security reviews, dependency scanning, OWASP compliance         |
| Browser compatibility issues                  | Medium      | Medium | Cross-browser testing, progressive enhancement                  |
| Scope creep                                   | High        | Medium | Clear requirements, regular stakeholder reviews                 |
