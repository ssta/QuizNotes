This is a clear format for a quiz game system. Let me break down the requirements and suggest a technology stack.

**Requirements Summary:**

1. **User Types:**
    - Quizmaster (requires login)
    - Players (nickname only)

2. **Key Features:**
    - Question management interface for quizmaster
    - Image upload capability
    - Multiple choice questions
    - Twitch stream integration
    - Web interface for players
    - Real-time scoring system
    - Time-based point calculation
    - Leaderboard display
    - Database storage

3. **Scoring System:**
    - Maximum 10000 points per question
    - 20-second time limit
    - Linear point reduction (500 points/second)
    - Negative scoring for wrong answers
    - Final leaderboard

**Recommended Technology Stack:**

1. **Backend:**
    - Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin) for the main application server
    - WebSocket support for real-time communication
    - Spring Security for authentication

2. **Frontend:**
    - React.js for the web interface
    - Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling
    - Socket.io for real-time updates

3. **Database:**
    - PostgreSQL for relational data storage
    - Amazon S3 or similar for image storage

4. **Integration:**
    - Twitch API for stream integration
    - WebSocket for real-time game state updates

**Clarifications Needed:**

1. **Quiz Flow:**
    - Can players join mid-quiz?
    - Should there be a waiting room before the quiz starts?
    - Can the quizmaster pause between questions?

2. **Player Management:**
    - How to handle duplicate nicknames?
    - Should there be any profanity filtering for nicknames?
    - Maximum number of players per quiz?

3. **Content Management:**
    - Maximum image size/supported formats?
    - Should questions be reusable across multiple quizzes?
    - Can quizmasters create question banks?

4. **Technical Requirements:**
    - Expected concurrent user load?
    - Geographic distribution of players?
    - Any specific browser compatibility requirements?

5. **Additional Features:**
    - Should there be a chat system?
    - Do you need analytics for quizmaster (e.g., question difficulty based on response times)?
    - Should there be a practice mode?

This system would be well-suited for a microservices architecture with these main components:

1. **Auth Service:**
    - Handle quizmaster authentication
    - Manage player sessions

2. **Quiz Management Service:**
    - Question CRUD operations
    - Image handling
    - Quiz session management

3. **Game Service:**
    - Real-time game state management
    - Score calculation
    - Player interaction handling

4. **Results Service:**
    - Leaderboard management
    - Historical data storage
    - Analytics

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or would you like to clarify any of the points raised?
